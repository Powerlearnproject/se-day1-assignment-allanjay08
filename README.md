#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering, a part of the Computer Science domain, deals with the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation emanating 
from software systems. This field employs engineering principles to ensure reliability and efficiency in software development. Some of the areas 
in this field are requirements analysis, system design, coding, testing, and maintaining systems

Importance in the Technology Industry:
1. Iterative and Incremental Development: It gives out well-worked-out techniques for management, simplification, and good outcome assurance in making software.
2. Scalability and Maintainability: It ensures that software systems can be scaled and maintained over time in an effective manner, accommodating changes in both requirements and technology.
3. Cost Efficiency: Due to extreme procedural applications, software engineering could reduce rework and errors, thus decreasing the final costs.
4. Risk Management: The best engineering practice is one which identifies risks up front and develops strategies to minimize them, with the result that the software becomes more reliable and secure.
5. User Satisfaction: To develop software such that users feel happier in receiving products or services because what they receive satisfies their desires and fulfills their needs and wants.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1950s - Emergence of Software Engineering: The term "software engineering" is traced back to the formation of the NATO Software Engineering 
  Conference. The conference was created in response to the "software crisis," an era of severely escalating challenges in software development 
  emanating from poorly designed and poorly managed software projects. It became the beginning of the era of formalization of practices in 
  software development.
2. 1970s - The Introduction of Structured Programming: The development of structured programming techniques and principles has tamed the 
  complexity that had ruled the software in earlier times and thereby increased the software reliability. Of central significance among them 
  entered such concepts as modularity and structured design.
3. 1990s - The Agile Revolution: Agile methodologies dating from the publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 gave new meaning to modern 
 software development. Approaches defined with Agile features demonstrate incremental development, customer collaboration, and the willingness to 
 embrace changes in software developmentâ€”that's quite unlike the typical Waterfall approach.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement analysis: A process of eliciting and analyzing needs of stakeholders to understand what a software system must accomplish.
2. System Design: It is the development of design details that is based on the requirements and that includes architectural design, data models, 
   and the system interfaces.
3. Implementation: Translate the system design into executable code using programming languages and development tools.
4. Testing: Verification relating to the compliance of software with requirements and a defect-free condition in the software read through the 
   various testing levels, including unit and integration.
5. Deployment: Releasing of the software to users or into production environments.
6. Support: Fixing problems encountered in the post-implementation stage to allow or making necessary updates or enhancements to the system to 
   function better.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Similarities.
1.Both methodologies are aimed towards delivering a functioning software product based on stakeholders and user needs.
2.In both cases, testing is a critical phase to ensure the software meets the necessary requirements and does not have any significant defects.
3.Both approaches involve creating and maintaining documentation throughout the project lifecycle.
Differences.
1.Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step process. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next while Agile uses an iterative 
approach where the project is divided into small, manageable increments or sprints. Each iteration involves planning, development, testing, and 
review.
2.Changes to requirements are difficult and expensive to implement once the project is in the later stages, as changes can disrupt the sequential 
process in the waterfall methodology whereas Agile embraces changes, allowing for ongoing adjustments and refinements based on feedback and 
evolving requirements.

Examples of scenarios where waterfall methodologies would be appropriate
1.Regulatory compliance projects like in healthcare to manage patient records
2.Educational or Training Software like a LMS software where functionality is fixed

Examples of scenarios where agile methodologies would be appropriate
1.Startups and new product development like a mobile app to allow for ever changing consumer needs
2.Client-Driven Projects with Frequent Feedback like a CRM system

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer:
- Duties: Develop, test, and maintain code; implement design specifications; debug, and resolve issues; liaise and collaborate with other
developers and other stakeholders to make sure the software fulfils its specifications.  

2. QA Engineer:
Designing and executing test plans; identifying and reporting bugs; ensuring the software meets quality standards; working closely with developers
to address issues and improve product quality.
4. Project Manager
 -Duties: Oversee the project from its initiation through to its completion; setting schedules, resources, and budgets; inter and intra team-coordination;
tying up of all business intents and project finalization; risk, and stake-holder communication. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1.Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
	Importance: Provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code in a single application. They improve productivity by integrating features 
  like code completion, version control, and debugging.
  Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA.
2.Version Control Systems (VCS):
  Importance: Track changes to code over time, facilitate collaboration, and manage different versions of the software. They help in maintaining 
  code integrity and enabling team collaboration.
  Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).
  
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Handling Complexity: The software systems do have an inherent capability to become complex and consequently hard to manage and understand.
   Strategy: Handle complexity with importance to modular design principles and thorough documentation.
2. Assuring Quality: The need to ship new features all the time competes with the need for reliable, bug-free software.
   Strategy: Create strict testing, line by line, if necessary, along with automated testing, and adhere to all best practices in code quality.
3. Dealing with Changing Requirements: Actually, requirements change quite often, so they affect the application of the project.
   Strategy: To deliver the project on time with the appropriate scope, adopt Agile methodologies to allow for more flexibility to changes and 
   keep communication with the stakeholders very.
4. Time and Resource Management: Meeting time deadlines and working within budgets constraints can be challenging.
   Strategy: Use the project management tools and techniques for tracking the progress, managing resources, and adapting the plans if required.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
 - Definition: Tests single pieces / functions in isolation to make sure that they work as expected.
 - Importance: It helps in identifying and rectifying problems that arise in the very early stage of development and ensures that individual parts 
   of the software are working correctly. 
2. Integration Testing 
  -Definition: Tests integrated components or systems for interaction works or proper functioning.
  -Importance: Detects problems caused by the interaction of different components, so that combined functionalities will lead to expected
   behaviors.
 3. System Testing 
  - Definition: Tests the overall and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
   -Importance: Ensures that the overall system is up to requirements and works as a whole. 
4. Acceptance
  -Definition: Checks if the software works on the requirements needed from it by the end users and interested parties.
  -Importance: This verifies that the software is ready to be deployed in addition to meeting the requirements by the users, more affirming this 
   in terms of adding value to the end users. In other words, each type of testing is important in maintaining the level of quality and 
   reliability of the software product in the context of a well-balanced quality assurance process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering is the process of creating and optimising prompt so as to generate the most accurate, relevant and useful responses. It 
 designs queries to make the best use of output from LLMs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more 
effective.
 Vague Prompt: "Explain the software development process."

 Improved Prompt: "Describe the key stages of the software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, 
 testing, and deployment."

 The improved prompt is more effective because it eliminates ambiguity and provides responses that are directly relevant to the questions 
 asked.It also provides more comprehensive and well orgnised responses.Generally, the improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear 
 instructions, focuses on specific details, and communicates the request clearly and simply, which leads to more accurate, relevant, and 
 structured responses.
